### Description

This utility is a simply searches the entire US city postal database to find your results. This is a revamped version of an earlier submission I made. You can search by city, state, zip code, area code, or by county. This code was well commented and should be a good example for anyone wanting to learn by example. The download is 736k since the database file itself is included in the download.
